Console / REPL for Jetpack developers.

Download latest XPI file form [downloads] and drag it over the Firefox to
install. If you intend to use this tool with SDK, most likely you want to
clone the repo to the `path/to/sdk/packages/` and use additional argument
`--extra-packages=console` with `cfx run`.

To play with jetpack console enter `console:` url.
